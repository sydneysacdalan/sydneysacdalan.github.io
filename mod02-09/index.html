              <p>Girls' Generation (Hangul: 소녀시대; RR: Sonyeo Sidae), also known as SNSD, is a South Korean girl group formed by S.M. Entertainment. The group is composed of eight members: Taeyeon, Sunny, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Yuri, Sooyoung, Yoona and Seohyun. Originally a nine-piece group (with Jessica, who later departed from the group in September 2014). Girls' Generation debuted in 2007 with their Korean eponymous debut album. Though the album gained some attention, it was not until 2009 that the group rose to fame with the single "Gee", which claimed the top spot on KBS's Music Bank for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks and was named the most popular song of the 2000s in South Korea by Melon. Girls' Generation further consolidated their popularity on the South Korean music scene with follow-up singles "Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)", "Oh!", and "Run Devil Run", which were released in mid-2009 and early 2010.

              In mid-2010, Girls' Generation signed with Nayutawave Records (present-day EMI Records Japan) to venture into the Japanese music scene. Their 2011 eponymous Japanese debut album peaked atop the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart and became the first album by a non-Japanese girl group to be certified "Million" by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. The group's third Korean studio album The Boys was released in October 2011 and became the best-selling album of 2011 in South Korea with sales of over 380,000 copies. An English version of the single "The Boys" was released by Interscope Records in an attempt to expand the group's endeavour to the global music scene. The group's 2013 fourth Korean studio album I Got a Boy was supported by the single "I Got a Boy", which was subjected to major attention from Western media following its winning the Video of the Year award at the inaugural YouTube Music Awards. Their fifth Korean studio album, Lion Heart, was released in 2015. In 2017, Girls' Generation released their sixth Korean studio album, Holiday Night, to commemorate the group's tenth debut anniversary.

              Girls' Generation's signature musical styles are characterized as electropop and bubblegum pop, though their sounds have varied widely, incorporating various genres including hip hop, R&B, and EDM. They have sold over 4.4 million albums and 30 million digital singles as of 2012. The group's immense popularity in their native country South Korea has earned them numerous accolades and the titles "The Nation's Singers" and "The Nation's Girl Group". Girls' Generation is also deemed one of the prominent figures of the Korean Wave and one of the most popular K-pop acts internationally. They are the first Asian girl group to achieve five music videos with over 100 million views on YouTube: "Gee", "I Got a Boy", "The Boys", "Mr. Taxi", and "Oh!". In Japan, they became the first non-Japanese girl group to have three number-one albums on the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart, and their three Japanese concert tours attracted a record-breaking 550,000 spectators, more than any other Korean girl group.</p>
              
              <h2>History</h2>
              <p>Formation and debut Prior to the group's debut, some of the members were already involved in the entertainment industry. Yoona had gone through about 200 auditions for music videos, dramas, and movies before becoming a singer for Girls' Generation.[5] Sooyoung was exposed to the Japanese music scene as a member of a pop duo named Route θ, which disbanded one year after its debut in 2002.[6][7]

              The first member of the group to join S.M. Entertainment's training system was Jessica in 2000, after she and her sister, Krystal Jung, were scouted in a mall in South Korea during a family vacation.[8] That same year, members Sooyoung and Hyoyeon were cast into S.M.'s training system through the 2000 S.M. Open Audition, in which Hyoyeon danced for her audition. Yuri was the next Girls' Generation member to become an S.M. trainee after coming second in the 2001 S.M. Youth Best Dancer competition. Yoona was cast the following year through the 2002 S.M. Saturday Open Casting Audition, where she sang and danced to her favorite singers, BoA and Britney Spears.[9] Seohyun, the group's youngest member, was scouted in the subway by an S.M. scout; she then auditioned in 2003, singing children's songs.[10]


              Girls' Generation performing at the 2008 Beach Volleyball Competition at Jamsil Arena in SeoulThe group's leader, Taeyeon, was cast in 2004 after winning first place in the S.M. Youth Singing Competition.[11][12] That same year, member Tiffany auditioned at S.M.'s Starlight Casting System in Los Angeles, and joined the company in October 2004.[13][14] The final member of the group to be added was Sunny, who had become an S.M. trainee in 1998 and trained for five years before moving to another company, Starworld. At Starworld, she trained to debut in a duo named Sugar, which never debuted. In 2007, on the recommendation of Japanese singer Ayumi Hamasaki, Sunny moved back to S.M. Entertainment and became a member of Girls' Generation.[15]

              In July 2007, Girls' Generation had their first stage performance on Mnet's School of Rock, where the group performed their first single, "Into the New World" (다시 만난 세계; Dasi mannan segye).[16] On August 5, 2007, the group officially made their debut on SBS's Inkigayo, where they performed the same song.[17] Girls' Generation subsequently released their self-titled debut studio album in November 2007, which was preceded by the singles "Girls' Generation" (소녀시대; Sonyeo sidae)—a remake of Lee Seung-cheol's 1989 song, and "Kissing You". Girls' Generation became the twelfth best-selling album of 2007 in South Korea, selling 56,804 copies.[18] The album has sold over 120,000 copies in the country as of 2009.[19] In March 2008, the album was re-released under the title Baby Baby.[20] The album was preceded by a single with the same name, which was released on digital music sites on March 17, 2008.[21]</p>

              <P>Musical styles
              "Gee" is a bubblegum pop and electropop song that is widely recognized as the "magnum opus" (literally the greatest) for modern Korean bubblegum pop genre.[164][165]
              "I Got a Boy" (2013)

               The group's 2013 single "I Got a Boy" is described as an eclectic mix of various genres including electropop and drum and bass.[166]

               "We don't have any desire now to create a popular song like "Gee". Of course if that happened, we would be perfectly happy, but what we continue to strive for is performance. Girls' Generation's key advantage as a group is performance and vocal line so we worry a lot over songs that will fulfill both of these areas."
               –Member Sooyoung discussing the group's music styles[167]
               Girls' Generation's music is predominantly bubblegum pop and electropop.[89][164] The group's early singles such as "Gee", "Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)" (2009), and "Oh!" (2010) are described as "cutesy" bubblegum pop;[168][169][170] "Gee" also features elements of techno and hip hop, as noted by Abigail Covington from The A.V. Club.[164] Nevertheless, the group's musical styles have varied widely ever since; Anzhe Zhang from the New York University wrote that despite the fact that Girls' Generation's styles are deemed "mainstream" in South Korea, the group "has grown sonically more experimental."[171]

               Their 2011 single "The Boys" departs for a more "mature" style from the group's previous emphasis on "cutesy" themes;[169] it incorporates elements from hip hop, a genre that Girls' Generation had never ventured into.[172] The titular studio album, according to AllMusic's reviewer Tim Sendra, includes uptempo dance tracks "with a straight pop radio feel."[173] Girls' Generation's 2012 single "Dancing Queen"—a remake of British singer Duffy's "Mercy" (2008)—features a "funky pop" production, as opposed to the group's signature electropop sound.[89] Their 2013 single "I Got a Boy" was noted for its eclectic musical style, utilizing various genres ranging from bubblegum pop, electropop and drum and bass to pop-rap, EDM, and dubstep.[166][174][175] Jeff Benjamin from Billboard lauded the song as "one of the most-forward thinking lead pop singles heard in any country."[166] Both aforementioned singles' parent album, I Got a Boy (2013), combines elements from a wide range of genres such as 1980s new wave, EDM, and classic and contemporary R&B.[176]

              Girls' Generation's 2014 EP, Mr.Mr., features "exciting" R&B sounds with "cool, simple" melodies.[177] AllMusic's Heather Phares also noted inspirations of EDM, hip hop, traditional K-pop sound, and late-1980s europop on the EP, which she labelled "a set of songs that offers something for every kind of Girls' Generation and expands their musical reach."[178] The group's 2015 album Lion Heart brings back their signature bubblegum pop sound;[179] its third single "You Think", however, is a hip hop song that incorporates trap beats in its instrumentation.[180]</p>
